##About this project

By the way, myft in terminal won the People's Choice at FT Hackday.

I'm really glad that people like this little idea. Thank you!

The code is really messy. This is my first attempt at NodeJS, and I only have two day.

Sorry it took so long to opensource this toy. I'm quite busy for the past few days.
